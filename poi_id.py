In general, features with higher importance scores are more sensitive to random shuffling 
of their values, which means they are more â€˜importantâ€™ for prediction. 
Beware that the shuffling is performed for one feature at a time, and although
a feature might seem unnecessary or less important because of its low (or negative) importance score, it
could be the case that it is correlated to other features that can still produce a â€˜goodâ€™ performance result.
