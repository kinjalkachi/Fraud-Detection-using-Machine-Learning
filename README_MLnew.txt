I have included 5 pickle files: my_dataset.pkl, my_classifier.pkl, my_feature_list.pkl,final_project_dataset.pkl,
				final_project_dataset_modified.pkl
I have also included following :
1) poi_id.py
2)poi_email_addresses.py
3)poi_names.txt
4)tester.py
5)tester.pyc
6)HTML file of all the Question answers asked.
7)And this README_ML document.

I have cited below links for my work:
1)For algorithm selection:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/algorithm-choice
2)http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html
3)http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/12/4-reasons-machine-learning-model-wrong.html

Changes made as per suggestions :

1)What is the exact final subset of features used?
2)What was the scoring operator used?
3) As two of my models Gaussian NB and Decision tree are showing good values of precion and recall of greater than 0.3 
without using feature scaling I have opted not to use feature scaling for this project.
